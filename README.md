### ummmmmm stuff ig:
Most of the info you'll need is on my pronouns page and patreon, idk what else to add here. Take an elabotation of some boundaries ig:
-  Anyone UNDER 13 (0-12) DO NOT INTERACT UNLESS FRIEND. I genuinely hate kids SO MUCH, but many younger people I interact with I have been friends with from the beginning, so they are an exception. Same thing with anyone over 18.

-  I may have "DNIUCF" in my name. If I do, this typically refers to anyone I have added on discord. So, if that's you, feel free to interact. Otherwise, I'll just ignore you or be very dry.

-  I've got some pretty bad anger issues, and barely ever think before talking (whoops). If I upset you, please let me know. I can be really snarky and just rude in general, so please set boundaries with me!

-  I LOVE CUDDLES + HUGS!! Please don't be afraid to come hang out around me, even if I have any sort of DNI. I just won't talk or respond.
 
-  I have a pretty crude sense of humor, so I apologise if I make you uncomfortable.

-  I typically go offtab randomly when playing, and don't pay very much attention to local chat. While I don't like having full conversations in whisper, that's typically the best way to reach me!

-  Please (ONLY IF YOU ARE COMFORTABLE, DON'T GO SHARING YOUR AGE TO STRANGERS ONLINE) tell me your age before/when we interact. This lets me adjust myself and make sure I'm being appropriate.

-  Please don't send me random friend requests. I won't accept them AT ALL. However, if we've had a conversation before I'll typically accept (but only if its longer than a "Hi, how are you.")

-  STOP COPYING MY SKINS! OH MY GOD I HAVE BEEN COPIED 4 TIMES NOW (AND COUNTING). I don't mind if you take inspo (heck, I'm honored you think my skins are that good) but please don't take HEAVY inspo or directly copy them. If you want to know how I did something, feel free to ask me tho! I might give you a tutorial if you want.

-  This will probably be expanded on in the future, I have no idea how to code ;3;

Heh, you should like... totally rate my music tast too
